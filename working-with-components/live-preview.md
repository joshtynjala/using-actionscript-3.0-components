# Live Preview

The Live Preview feature lets you view components on the Stage as they will
appear in the published Flash content; the components appear at their
approximate size.

The live preview reflects different parameters for different components. For
information about which component parameters are reflected in the live preview,
see each component entry in the
_[ActionScript 3.0 Reference for the Adobe Flash Platform](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/index.html)_.

Components in Live Preview are not functional. To test functionality, you must
use the ControlÂ \> Test Movie command.
