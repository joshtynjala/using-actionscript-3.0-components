# Introduction

Adobe® Flash® CS5 Professional is the standard authoring tool for producing
high-impact web experiences. Components are the building blocks for the rich
Internet applications that provide these experiences. A _component_ is a movie
clip with parameters that allow you to customize the component either during
authoring in Flash or at run time with Adobe® ActionScript® methods, properties,
and events. Components are designed to allow developers to reuse and share code,
and to encapsulate complex functionality that designers can use and customize
without using ActionScript.

Components allow you to easily and quickly build robust applications with a
consistent appearance and behavior. This manual describes how to build
applications with Adobe ActionScript 3.0 components. The _Adobe® ActionScript®
3.0 Language and Components Reference_ describes each component's application
programming interface (API).

You can use components created by Adobe®, download components created by other
developers, or create your own components.
