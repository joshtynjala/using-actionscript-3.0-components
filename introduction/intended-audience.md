# Intended audience

This manual is for developers who are building Flash applications and want to
use components to speed development. You should already be familiar with
developing applications in Flash and writing ActionScript.

If you are less experienced with writing ActionScript, you can add components to
a document, set their parameters in the Property inspector or Component
inspector, and use the Behaviors panel to handle their events. For example, you
could attach a Go To Web Page behavior to a Button component that opens a URL in
a web browser when the button is clicked without writing any ActionScript code.

If you are a programmer who wants to create more robust applications, you can
create components dynamically, use ActionScript to set properties and call
methods at run time, and use the event listener model to handle events.

For more information, see
[Working with Components](../working-with-components/index.md).
