# System requirements

Flash components do not have any system requirements beyond the system
requirements for Flash.

Any SWF file that uses Flash CS3 or later components must be viewed with Adobe®
Flash® Player 9.0.28.0 or later, and must be published for ActionScript 3.0 (you
can set this through File \> Publish Settings, in the Flash tab).
