# Using the FLVPlayback Component

The FLVPlayback component lets you easily include a video player in your Adobe
Flash CS5 Professional application to play progressively downloaded video files
over HTTP, or streaming video files from Adobe's Macromedia Flash Media Server,
or from a Flash Video Streaming Service (FVSS).

With the release of Adobe Flash Player 9 Update 3 (version 9.0.115.0 or later),
significant improvements for playing video content in Flash Player have been
incorporated. This update includes changes to the FLVPlayback component that
take advantage of the end user's system video hardware to provide better video
playback performance. The changes to the FLVPlayback component also increase the
fidelity of video files displayed in full-screen mode.

Additionally, Flash Player 9 Update 3 improves the functionality of the
FLVPlayback component by adding support for the high-definition MPEG-4 video
formats that utilize industry standard H.264 encoding. These formats include
MP4, M4A, MOV, MP4V, 3GP, and 3G2.

> **Note:** Protected MP4 files—such as those downloaded from Apple® iTunes® or
> digitally encrypted by FairPlay®—are not supported.
