# Customize the FLVPlayback component

This section explains how to customize the FLVPlayback component. Most of the
methods used to customize other components, however, do not work with the
FLVPlayback component. To customize the FLVPlayback component, use only the
techniques described in this section.

You have the following choices for customizing the FLVPlayback component: select
a predesigned skin, skin FLV Playback Custom UI components individually, or
create a new skin. You can also use FLVPlayback properties to modify the
behavior of a skin.

Note: You must upload your skin SWF file to the web server along with your
application SWF file for the skin to work with your FLVPlayback component.
